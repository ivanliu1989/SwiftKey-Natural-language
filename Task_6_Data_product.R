### Tasks to accomplish ###
###########################
# 1. Create a data product to show off your prediction algorithm You should create a Shiny app that 
# accepts an n-gram and predicts the next word.

#############################
### Questions to consider ###
#############################
# 1. What are the most interesting ways you could show off your algorithm?
# 2. Are there any data visualizations you think might be helpful 
# (look at the Swiftkey data dashboard if you have it loaded on your phone)?
# 3. How should you document the use of your data product (separately from how you created it) 
# so that others can rapidly deploy your algorithm?

###############################
### Tips, tricks, and hints ###
###############################
# 1. Consider the size of the predictive model you have developed. 
# You may have to sacrifice some accuracy to have a fast enough/small enough model to load into Shiny.
