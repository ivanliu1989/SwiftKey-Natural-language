### Tasks to accomplish ###
###########################
# 1. Exploratory analysis - perform a thorough exploratory analysis of the data, 
# understanding the distribution of words and relationship between the words in the corpora.
# 2. Understand frequencies of words and word pairs - build figures and tables 
# to understand variation in the frequencies of words and word pairs in the data.

#############################
### Questions to consider ###
#############################
# 1. Some words are more frequent than others - what are the distributions of word frequencies? 
# 2. What are the frequencies of 2-grams and 3-grams in the dataset? 
# 3. How many unique words do you need in a frequency sorted dictionary 
# to cover 50% of all word instances in the language? 90%? 
# 4. How do you evaluate how many of the words come from foreign languages? 
# 5. Can you think of a way to increase the coverage -- identifying words that 
# may not be in the corpora or using a smaller number of words in the dictionary 
# to cover the same number of phrases?
