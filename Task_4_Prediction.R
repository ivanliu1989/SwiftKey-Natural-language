### Tasks to accomplish ###
###########################
# 1. Build a predictive model based on the previous data modeling steps - 
# you may combine the models in any way you think is appropriate.
# 2. Evaluate the model for efficiency and accuracy - use timing software to evaluate the computational complexity of your model. 
# Evaluate the model accuracy using different metrics like perplexity, accuracy at the first word, second word, and third word.

#############################
### Questions to consider ###
#############################
# 1. How does the model perform for different choices of the parameters and size of the model? 
# 2. How much does the model slow down for the performance you gain?
# 3. Does perplexity correlate with the other measures of accuracy?
# 4. Can you reduce the size of the model (number of parameters) without reducing performance?
